Intuition
To find the missing number in the array, we can utilize the fact that all numbers from 0 to n are expected to be present in the array, where n is the length of the array. Thus, we can calculate the sum of the expected sequence of numbers using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. By subtracting the actual sum of the numbers in the array from this expected sum, we can determine the missing number.

Approach
Calculate the expected sum of the sequence of numbers from 0 to n using the formula 𝑛×(𝑛+1)/2.
Iterate through the given array and calculate the actual sum of the numbers present in the array.
Subtract the actual sum from the expected sum to find the missing number.
Return the missing number.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(1)

class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int expectedsum=(nums.length*(nums.length+1))/2;
        int cursum=0;
        for(int num:nums)
        {
            cursum+=num;
        }
        return expectedsum-cursum;
    }
}
